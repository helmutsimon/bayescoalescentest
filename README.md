# bayescoalescentest

## 1. OVERVIEW
bayescoalescentest estimates several parameters for coalescent trees using Bayesian inference on genomic data sampled from a study population (sample size = n). The data  may take the form of a folded or unfolded site frequency spectrum (SFS). In the former case, the ancestral states are unknown and ancestral probabilities are inferred by the software. In Bayesian style, samples from a posterior distribution are generated for estimated quantities and expected values of these may be taken as point estimates for those quantities.

The software assumes selective neutrality. The coalescent process generating the data can then be taken as determined by the population history. The software can be used without any knowledge of this demographic history, by using an uninformative prior distribution. Alternatively, any demographic model that can be simulated (e.g. by Hudson ms or derivatives such as msprime or msms) can also be used to generate a prior distribution using an MVN approximation (model-based prior). These types of prior distributions are novel and extend the scope of the software beyond the standard assumption that data is generated by a Wright-Fisher (constant population size) population genetic model. See below and bioRxiv paper for more on these prior distributions.

The coalescent quantities that can be directly inferred are:

* branch lengths, specifically the joint distribution of branch lengths;
* the basal split (the sizes of the two groups into which the sample is split by the first bifurcation occurring at the root of the coalescent tree);
* the total tree length
* the mutation rate. This can be estimated from a uniform distribution if a model-based prior is used. If an uninformative prior is used, an estimate of mutation rate, together with a standard error is required as input. The mutation rate is then re-estimated by the software.

Other quantities may be derived from the above either by arithmetic operations on posterior distributions, or by finding the mean of some calculated quantity over the posterior distribution.
* coalescent times are a cumulative sum of branch lengths;
* the ancestral process. This is a set of functions of time, indexed by k for k=1,...n, which give the probability that the sample had k ancestors at time t before the present;
* the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). The TMRCA can be estimated as the sum of branch lengths. This can become unreliable if the sample size is high and the number of segregating sites does not increase at the same rate, as is typical of estimates where additional samples increase the number of quantities (in this case branch lengths) being estimated. The result is that the prior distribution comes to have a stronger influence on the posterior distribution, as compared to the relatively thin data. This is unfortunately often the case with data from natural populations. For sample sizes up to 20, say, results are more often reasonable. It is recommended that the unbiassed estimate of TMRCA introduced by Russell Thomson be used as a comparison, and this estimate is generally included in output. This does not apply to the same extent if a well-founded model-based prior is used.
* probabilities may be calculated for other ad hoc hypotheses: for example, that one particular branch length is greater than another. Like the computation of ancestral probabilities, this is possible because we sample from the joint distribution of branch lengths.

The software also provides methods for visualising the posterior distributions.

Theory and examples are available in the manuscript: Simon, H. and Huttley, G., 2021 *Bayesian Inference of Joint Coalescence Times for Sampled Sequences*. bioRxiv doi = 10.1101/2021.07.23.453461.

## 1. INSTALLATION (for PyMC3 3.11.2)

### 1.1 Create Conda environment and install PyMC3 (see https://discourse.pymc.io/t/pymc3-final-stable-release-on-conda/8172)

```
conda create --name pymc3.11.2 python=3.9
conda activate pymc3.11.2
conda install -c conda-forge mkl pymc3 theano-pymc
pip3 install jupyter
```

The following packages should be installed:

cogent3, scipy, numpy, pandas, more-itertools, click, scitrack, matplotlib, seaborn, msprime (if simulations are required)

### 1.2 Clone bayescoalescentest repository from GitHub.

## 2. RUN BAYESIAN MODEL (python_scripts/run_bayesian_model.py)


run_bayesian_model.py requires an input file consisting of a Python list, pickled and compressed with gzip. The list contains two elements. The first is a site frequency spectrum comprising a list of integers.
The second is a list of true branch lengths comprising a list of real numbers. True branch lengths are only available for data produced from a simulation, otherwise the second element of the list should be None. 
The input file is zipped and pickled (see nbks/Pre-process_Nuu_Chah_Nulth_data.ipynb for an example of how to create such a file).
The file should reside in ./data directory (or use -dir option for a different directory name).

Mandatory parameters for run_bayesian_model.py are a job_number (used to label output), the sample size, n and the name of the input file described above.

run_bayesian_model.py can use an uninformative prior or a model-based (multivariate normal or MVN) prior.

For the uninformative prior, the following parameter is also required:

    -m   mutation rate: mean and standard deviation of estimate of **sequence** mutation rate, e.g. -m 2.38e-4 1e-5

For the MVN prior, the following parameters are required:

    -f   identifier for file containing samples of relative branch lengths and branch lengths used to generate the parameters for the MVN prior.
	For example, if the identifier is XXX, these files must be called relbrlens_XXX.csv and brlens_XXX.csv and located in the data directory.
	The script simulate_multiples.py is supplied to generate such files using msprime.
	If this parameter is not given, this indicates that the uninformative prior is used.

    -l	lower and upper limits for **sequence** mutation rate (uniform prior distribution), e.g. -l 0 1e-3


Other parameters control how the MCMC process is run. The most useful, because PyMC3 output may suggest they be modified to improve convergence, are:

    -d  number of MCMC draws, default = 50000.
    -ta target acceptance, default=0.9.
    -c  number of cores, default set by system.
    -t  number of tuning steps, default is 20% of number of draws.

Remaining parameters are primarily for experimental purposes.

The primary output is a file containing samples from the posterior distribution of branch lengths. The primary tool to analyse/visualise this output is the Jupiter notebook 'plots_and_tables/plots and tables.ipynb'.

## 3. DATA SIMULATION (python_scripts/simulate_population.py)


simulate_population.py allows simulated data to be generated using msprime, creating an input file for run_bayesian_model.py. It generates an output file containing a list of SFS and 
the true branch lengths of the tree generated by the simulation. Mandatory parameters are:

    - job_no  (used to label output)
    - population size
    - **site** mutation rate
    - length  (length of genome segment being analysed in base pairs
    - initial population growth rate per generation
    - sample size

Optional parameters are:

    -d  directory name for data, default is 'data'
    -e  events_file. This is used for more complex demographies. It is a .csv file with columns headed 'time', 'size' and 'rate'. For each row the 'time' field is the number of generations into the past at which a demographic change occurred. 'Size' and 'rate' are the population size and growth rate from that time point (going backward into past).  The initial population size and growth rate (from time=0) are given by the mandatory parameters.

## 4. USE INFORMATIVE (MVN) PRIOR (simulate_multiples.py)


simulate_multiples.py generates csv files of samples of branch lengths and relative branch lengths as input to run_bayesian_model.py if an MVN prior is used.
Other simulation software could in principle be used for this purpose.
Mandatory parameters for simulate_multiples.py are:

    - job_no  (used to label output)
    - sample size
    - population size
    - **site** mutation rate
    - length  (length of genome segment being analysed in base pairs
    - population growth rate per generation
    - number of samples to generate
    
Optional parameters are:

    -d  directory name for data, default is 'data'
    -e  events_file. As for simulate_population.py

## 5. PRESENT AND VISUALISE RESULTS (plots_and_tables/plots and tables.ipynb)


    This Jupiter notebook allows display of posterior distributions of branch lengths and coalescent times in the form of line graphs and heat maps. It also calculates expected values, as well as calculating and graphing 'ancestral probabilities'.
